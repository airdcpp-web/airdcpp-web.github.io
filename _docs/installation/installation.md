# Installation

## Windows

Web functionality is included in the regular [AirDC++ desktop application](http://www.airdcpp.net/).

**[Download AirDC++ for Windows](http://www.airdcpp.net/download)**

After you have downloaded the client, you may enable web functionality from `File` -> `Settings` -> `Web server`.

## Linux/UNIX

### Portable binaries for Linux

Precompiled versions are available for Linux.

**[Download Linux binaries](/docs/installation/linux-binaries.html)**

Note that the binaries are not compatible with FreeBSD or other non-Linux platforms.


### Platform-specific packages

- [Gentoo](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-p2p/airdcpp-webclient)

## OS X

There is no installation package available at the moment but developers are able to compile the client from source. See [this issue](https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-webclient/issues/37) for more information about the OS X package status.

## Other platforms

You may either [compile the application by yourself](/docs/installation/compiling.html) or use one of the [third-party docker images](https://hub.docker.com/search/?isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&page=1&pullCount=0&q=airdcpp&starCount=0).
