# Setting up an own hub

## Recommended hub software

### [Luadch](http://luadch.github.io)

A cross-platform hubsoft with easy initial setup. Actively maintained. Not recommended for hubs with thousands of users due to performance reasons.

### [uhub](https://www.uhub.org) (Linux/UNIX)

A high-performance hubsoft for Unix-like operating systems with basic functionality.

### [ADCH++](http://adchpp.sourceforge.net) (Windows)

Can be also installed on non-Windows operating systems but the installation experience isn't the smoothest one.

There's also a special version of the hubsoft available that supports hybrid IPv4/IPv6 connectivity (allows users to be active simultaneously via both IP protocols). The Windows builds can be found from [here](https://builds.airdcpp.net/adchpp/) and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maksis/adchpp-hbri/) that can be compiled on Linux. Please see the `Servers` section of the included `adchpp.xml` file for setup instructions.


### [Flexhub](http://www.flexhub.org)

A multi-platform hubsoft with easy initial setup. Not being actively maintained, may not pass all commands between clients, has encoding issues and is not recommended for large hubs.
